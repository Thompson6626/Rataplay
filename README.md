# 🧠 Rataplay – Terminal Minigame Collection in Rust

**Rataplay** is a terminal-based minigame collection written in **Rust**, powered by the [`ratatui`](https://github.com/tui-rs/ratatui) TUI framework.

Currently inspired by the classic [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/) games, Rataplay offers a growing suite of minigames that test your reflexes, memory, and attention — all from your terminal.
