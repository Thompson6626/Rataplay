# Rataplay â€“ Terminal Minigame Collection in Rust

**Rataplay** is a terminal-based collection of minigames built in **Rust**, using the [`ratatui`](https://github.com/tui-rs/ratatui) TUI framework.

It draws inspiration from classic [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/) games, bringing quick reflex and memory challenges to the terminal.
